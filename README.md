# Super-sampled rendering in Vulkan

This sample show a Vulkan implementation of the super-sampled technique explained here:

http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10.5/opengl/src/FroggyAA/doc/FroggyAA.pdf

The source code contains two implementations:

* OpenGL original implementation
* Vulkan implementation

This sample shows also a way to write Vulkan code in a rather more compact fashion: by using constructors and functors. Details of this part are in NVK.cpp.
